"""One of the best places to work.""",https://www.glassdoor.com//Reviews/Employee-Review-Google-RVW32867944.htm,"Amazing place the work. Great culture, great pay, great projects.",Very difficult to get promoted.,Google
"""Moving at the speed of light, burn out is inevitable""",https://www.glassdoor.com//Reviews/Employee-Review-Google-RVW2757802.htm,"1) Food, food, food.  15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone.  Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks.  Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus).  Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available.  Bowling alley.  Volley ball pit.  Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV).  Free health/fitness assessments.  Dog-friendly.  Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation.  In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically).  In practice, not true.  

6)  You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry.  There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).","1) Work/life balance.  What balance?  All those perks and benefits are an illusion.  They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive.  I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.  You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down.  I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us.  Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am.  It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2) Poor management.  I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence.  Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult.""  People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into.  So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.  Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.

3) Jerks.  Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same).  Years ago, that wasn't the case.  I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience.  I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.

4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.  So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing.  Google says, ""Don't be evil.""  But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices.  :(",Google
"""Great balance between big-company security and fun, fast-moving projects""",https://www.glassdoor.com//Reviews/Employee-Review-Google-RVW4204034.htm,"* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.
* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).
* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.
* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.

Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.
* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.
* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.",Google
"""The best place I've worked and also the most demanding.""",https://www.glassdoor.com//Reviews/Employee-Review-Google-RVW5873129.htm,"You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.

You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world

You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.

You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing

You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable. 

There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.

Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.

Google cares about how it treats its employees.

The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.

There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.

You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.

If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors. 

The company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk.","I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.

Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.

You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning.  No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard.

After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear. 

It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.

When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you.  Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.

It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge.   I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out.",Google

"""An Amazing Place to Work""",https://www.glassdoor.com//Reviews/Employee-Review-Amazon-RVW19389841.htm,"I've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction.

The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.","No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that.

Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse.",Amazon Web Services
"""Can be amazing for some people, horrible for others""",https://www.glassdoor.com//Reviews/Employee-Review-Amazon-RVW3431779.htm,"Amazon is doing lot's of cool stuff...but lots of boring stuff too.  There are really well run teams...and very badly run teams.  The experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board, from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year.

 - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian.  You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived.  You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned.  There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long.
  - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue)
  - A chance to make a huge difference
  - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself
  - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions).
  - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain","- You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that.
- Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today.  It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

"""We are now in a world where we are condescended to by our inferiors""",https://www.glassdoor.com//Reviews/Employee-Review-Amazon-RVW14315095.htm,This company gets A list performance from C list employees.  The culture is quick and hard charging.  You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.,"Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways.

Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey.  This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon.  The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people.""

The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism.  Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street.",Amazon Web Services
"""An Engineer's Dream""",https://www.glassdoor.com//Reviews/Employee-Review-Amazon-RVW32657380.htm,"Lots of autonomy. Engineering teams drive the company and are heavily involved in planning, design, and business decisions. My manager, PM, and even director look to me (an SDE-I right out of college) for input and expertise all the time. As an engineer, you have as much influence as you are willing to exert, so long as you have the skills and knowledge to back it up. 

Different work schedules/styles are flexible and supported. Some of my teammates take 1 WFH day per week to help balance family needs, others come in at 11am because they're just not morning people. As long as you are present when needed (like for meetings), and are delivering good work, you have lots of freedom to make the job work with your life. It's a small convenience to be able to schedule something like a doctor's appointment any day of the week and not have to ask permission of my manager or log ""sick day"" hours, but it really does help reduce life stress. 

Incredible growth potential. Clear guidelines for how to advance in your role are available to you from day 1. Easy mobility within the company, plenty of room to explore almost any technology/role you could ever want to try without leaving the company. As an entry-level software engineer, you can direct your career become a TPM, SDM, Principal, Data Engineer, or just about anything else you desire. Networking within the company is easy and there are internal tools and groups to support it. 

Pay and benefits are good, as well as stock bonuses.","Onboarding felt like being thrown into a pool with no knowledge of how to swim. This isn't so much a con as a caution: if you aren't willing to push through confusion, read documentation, experiment and fail, and teach yourself new things every day, then you won't be very successful or happy.

These products are all about team potential, team performance, team productivity so no wonder Atlassian itself is big on teams too. The place is full of great people to work with. They are great not only technically (check LinkedIn yourself) but also as great colleagues to enjoy working with. There is a strong balance and partnership among engineering, product management, UX design, and data analytics. 

Part of the growth in business comes from the original and very successful products like Jira and Confluence. Part also comes from the newly acquired products such as Trello and OpsGenie. There is a strong theme in this expansion strategy to keep unleashing the potential of all teams, starting with the tech teams.

Atlassian is one of the unique companies whose values do make sense (check them out yourself) and there is a real strong focus for all team members to live those values. Part of every interview does also include a session on the value(s) you may most identify with and why.

Atlassian is also a place for a new software engineer to get up to speed fast. The products are those exact ones (or similar to the ones) that you as a software engineer would be using in any company to develop your own products -- workflow management, internal wiki and collaboration, operations status, operations alerting, source code repository, etc. Knowing that your contributions make people like you far more productive is very satisfying. There is also real dogfooding going on at Atlassian as you end up using the same products for your development effort. If you get a chance to see how these products are used internally, you will amazed about the capabilities of these products -- unfortunately not well known outside, a mistake that Atlassian needs to fix. 

There is attention to detail in almost every aspect. For example, visit one of the Atlassian offices and you can see the difference. Go to youtube and find videos on the Atlassian founders. They are smart, passionate engineers themselves (with an Aussie accent :) and they get it right away whatever you are discussing. They can code very well too.

There is a real strong positivity in the air at Atlassian. There is real caring for the teams inside or outside the company.

The work here is extremely challenging and interesting and WLB is beyond par. Benefits are triple-A. Everyone leaves at 5:30pm. Not only it's encouraged to rest, but you are also more productive and focused when you can also enjoy life outside the company and not be in a pressure cooker.
Bloomberg is moving at a very rapid pace towards bleeding-edge technologies (open source stacks, C++17, python, Scala, AI, ML, etc) and every project is a new learning opportunity. Employees are given a lot of freedom to explore coding and exceling at what they like. Everyone is encouraged nowadays to switch to personal laptops which are top-of-the-line MacBook Pros. I've never seen this company cut corners on quality and on its commitment to the well being of its employees. If you get bored or start stagnating within a group, you are encouraged to move elsewhere in the company and play with different gadgets. Bottom line is the perks are incredible and the company really invests in its people. The quality of it's products is absurdly good, and it's only possible when you have a well tuned engineering machine. All this trickles down from Mike Bloomberg himself who, as anyone has seen during the election campaign, is beyond reproach as a human being. 
If you get a chance to interview and are offered a position here, don't go elsewhere.  This is not a backstabbing culture like in other companies, reviews are very open and each developer is always given enough feedback for his work.

This is however balanced by a higher than normal base salary and with the stability that this company brings, it's great if you are a family person and need to rely on a constant stream of income. 
The second negative stems a bit from the first one.
